Introduction 
The rapid development of 5G networks, which aim to provide ultra-reliable and low-latency 
communications (URLLC) for applications such as autonomous vehicles, remote surgery, and 
industrial automation, has brought about stringent requirements for delay and throughput. 
URLLC is a key aspect of 5G that requires communication systems to operate with extremely 
low latency and high reliability. These requirements necessitate new approaches to multi
hop communications, where data is relayed through multiple nodes to reach its destination. 
Traditional communication protocols based on Shannon capacity, which focus on 
maximizing data throughput, are no longer sufficient in this context. The primary goal now is 
to minimize the delay while maintaining reliable communication at a certain data rate, 
making new design approaches crucial to meet the URLLC requirements of new networks. 
The industry standard protocols are not practical for delay-constrained communication 
systems, particularly for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, due to its high delay with 
state-of-the-art error correcting codes. 
In this project, we are proposing a new way to improve communication in URLLC networks 
by using a technique called Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM). TCM is a type of coding and 
signal processing that allows us to send data through multiple relay nodes with low delay. 
Unlike traditional methods, we don't need to fully decode the entire data frame, which can 
be time-consuming. Our goal is to achieve better performance compared to traditional 
systems in terms of delay, while also keeping the designs easy to implement in real-world 
applications. 
To achieve this goal, we will develop a simulation model in MATLAB to implement a 
communication system employing TCM and relaying. Different signal processing algorithms 
will be designed and tested to determine the optimal trade-off between data reliability and 
latency.  
With the ever-increasing demand for low-latency applications in modern communication 
systems, the results of this project have the potential to contribute to the development of 
practical solutions for multi-hop communications that meet the stringent requirements of 
URLLC
